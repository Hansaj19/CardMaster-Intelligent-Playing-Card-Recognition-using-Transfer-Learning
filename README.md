# Notes
Dataset are excluded from GitHub to keep repo clean.
### To download the dataset, run the following script in Notebook once.

```python
!mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
!copy kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
!chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
!kaggle datasets download -d gpiosenka/cards-image-datasetclassification
!unzip cards-image-datasetclassification.zip -d cards_dataset
import zipfile
with zipfile.ZipFile("cards-image-datasetclassification.zip", 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall("cards_dataset")
```

Make sure to place dataset manually or download as instructed above.
